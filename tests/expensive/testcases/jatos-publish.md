How can I create a link so that participants can run my experiment online?

The answer should:

- Indicate that the experiment should be set to run 'In a browser with OSWeb' in experiment properties
- Indicate that you need to upload the experiment to a JATOS server
- Option 1:
    - Indicate that once you're logged into JATOS, you can generate an API token, which should be entered in OpenSesame in the OSWeb and JATOS control panel
    - Indicate that you can now use the 'Publish to JATOS' option in OpenSesame
- Option 2:
    - Indicate that you can export the experiment in OpenSesame and import it in the JATOS web interface
- Option 1 and option 2 are both ok, but option 1 is preferred
