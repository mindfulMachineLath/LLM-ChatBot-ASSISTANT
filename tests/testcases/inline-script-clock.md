I would like to insert a delay of 1.5 s using a Python script. How can I do that?

The answer should:

- Refer to a Python inline_script
- Use `clock.sleep(1500)`

The answer should not not:

- Refer to durations specified in GUI items
- Use JavaScript
- Use `self.sleep()`
- Use the Python `time` module
