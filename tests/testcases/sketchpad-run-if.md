I have a sketchpad that I would like to show only after an incorrect response. Can you show me how to do that?

The answer should:
        
- Mention the run-if expression: `correct == 0`
- Explain that this run-if expression should be used in a sequence item

The answer should *not*:

- Refer to Python inline_script or contain other Python code, although markdown code blocks are allowed
- Refer to JavaScript inline_javascript or contain other JavaScript code, although markdown code blocks are allowed
- Refer to a show-if expression
