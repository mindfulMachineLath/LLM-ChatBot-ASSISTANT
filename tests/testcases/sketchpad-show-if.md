I have a single sketchpad that contains a central arrow cue. I have defined a `cue` variable in a loop, which can be "right" or "left". Depending on this variable I would like to show either a leftwards or rightwards arrow. Can you show me how?

The answer should:

- Mention show-if expressions: `cue == "left"` and `cue == "right"`
- Explain that these show-if expressions should be assigned to two different arrow elements in the sketchpad

The answer should * not*:

- Refer to Python inline_script or contain other Python code
- Refer to JavaScript inline_javascript or contain other JavaScript code
- Refer to a run-if expression or use multiple sketchpads
