My OpenSesame log file contains many variables that I don't need. I would like to select only a handful of relevant variables, such as condition, response time, correct, subject_nr, etc. How can I do that?

The answer should:

- Refer to the logger GUI item
- Suggest disabling the 'Automatically log all variables' option
- Suggest adding variables to the 'Include' list

The answer should *not*:

- Refer to the Python `log` object
- Refer to Python inline_script or contain other Python code
- Refer to JavaScript inline_javascript or contain other JavaScript code
