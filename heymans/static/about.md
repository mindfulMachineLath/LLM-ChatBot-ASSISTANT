## What can Sigmund do?

Before answering a question, Sigmund searches for relevant sections in the documentation of OpenSesame and DataMatrix. Relevant sections are then provided to Sigmund along with your question so that Sigmund is able to provide correct answers about things that it does not know very well. Because of this, Sigmund is much better at answering questions about OpenSesame and DataMatrix than other chatbots are.

In addition, Sigmund also has basic code execution and Google Scholar search capabilities. These will be expanded in the future.


## How can I get an account?

Sigmund is currently in limited beta and by invitation only. If you have received an invitation, you can log in using your account from <https://forum.cogsci.nl/>. 


## Privacy

Sigmund encrypts all messages using a key that is based on your password. This means that no-one, including the system administrators, can read your messages.

Sigmund uses the large-language-model API provided by OpenAI. OpenAI does not use data that they receive through the API for any purposes other than replying to the request. Notably, your data will not be used to train their models. For more information, see their terms of service:

## What AI technology is Sigmund based on?

Sigmund is an open-source pipeline that is built on top of the OpenAI large-language-model API. For simple tasks, such as searching and summarizing, it uses GPT 3.5 turbo, which is the same model that is used by the free version of ChatGPT. For complex tasks, notably answering questions, it uses GPT 4 turbo, which is the same model that is used by the paid version of ChatGPT.
