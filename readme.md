# Heymans AI tutor

Copyright 2023 Sebastiaan Math√¥t

This is a working prototype of an AI-based tutor that asks open-ended questions to students based on sections from a textbook. The AI gives feedback until the student answers the question correctly. This is intended as formative testing.

Heymans uses OpenAI chat models and required an OpenAI API key.


## Installation

Download the source code and create a `config.py` in the main source folder (i.e. alongside `heymans.py`)"

```python
page_title = 'Heymans AI'
server_port = 5000
server_url = 'http://localhost:5000'
ai_name = 'Heymans'  # How the AI calls itself
max_chat_length = 20
# Default student identifiers
default_name = 'Anonymous Student'
default_student_nr = 'S12345678'
# Defines which courses exist and which chapters each course has
course_content = {
    'course_code_1': {
        'title': 'Course Title 1',
        'chapters': {
            '1': 'First Chapter',
            '2': 'Second Chapter'
        }
    },
    'course_code_2': {
        'title': 'Course Title 2',
        'chapters': {
            '1': 'First Chapter',
            '2': 'Second Chapter'
        }
    }
}
openai_api_key = 'your_openai_api_key_here'
model = 'gpt-4'  # 'dummy' for testing, 'gpt-3.5-turbo' for simpler model


def is_valid_student_nr(student_nr):
    """Takes a student number and returns True if it is valid."""
    return True
```

Next, for each chapter, organize `.txt` files with sections from that chapter in the following way:

```
sources/course_code_1/1/1.1.txt
sources/course_code_1/1/1.2.txt
sources/course_code_1/1/1.3.txt
...
sources/course_code_2/2/2.1.txt
sources/course_code_2/2/2.2.txt
sources/course_code_2/2/2.3.txt
```

Each course also needs a template for the system prompt, which contains general instructions for the model. This should be organized as follows:

```
sources/course_code_1/prompt_template.txt
```

The prompt template is a ninja2 template that contains various placeholders that will be filled in based on the configuration and user identity. For example:

```
You are a friendly tutor for an introductory psychology course. Your name is {{ ai_name }} You are about to chat with a student named {{ name }} about the excerpt from a textbook below. The student is a beginner, so keep questions and feedback simple.

<textbook>
{{ source }}
</textbook>

The chat session is structured as follows:

- Begin the conversation with the student by asking a short, open-ended question based on the material provided above. Indicate which section is the basis for the question.
- Evaluate the student's response to determine if it sufficiently demonstrates understanding of the concept(s).
- If the response does not connect to the question, remind the student that the assignment should be taken seriously.
- If the response resembles the textbook or your own feedback, remind the student to use his or her own words.
- If the response is satisfactory, conclude the teaching session. Do not offer to continue the conversation. End your response with <FINISHED>.
- If it the response is not satisfactory, provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
- After providing feedback, allow the student to respond with an improved answer. Continue this feedback cycle until the answer demonstrates a satisfactory understanding of the concept(s).
```

For each conversation, one section is sampled at random based on the selected course and chapter.

Next, start Heymans:

```
python heymans.py
```

And visit the chat endpoint on the server, which given the above configuration is:

```
https://localhost:5000/chat
```
