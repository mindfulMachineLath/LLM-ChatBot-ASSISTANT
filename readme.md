# Heymans/ Sigmund AI tutor

Copyright 2023 Sebastiaan Math√¥t


This is a working prototype of an AI-based chatbot that provides sensible answers based on documentation.

Features:

- Privacy: all messages are encrypted so that no-one can listen in on your conversation
- Knowledge: access to OpenSesame documentation 
- Cpntinuous conversation: the conversation is held in a continuous thread

Heymans uses OpenAI (gpt3.5, gpt4) and/ or Anthropic (claude 2.1) chat models and requires API keys.

**Note: for the Q&A and practice bot for teaching, checkout `release/0.3.0`. The current codebase focuses on a conversational chatbot for user support.**
