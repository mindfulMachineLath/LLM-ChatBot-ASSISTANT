# Sigmund AI

Copyright 2023-2024 Sebastiaan Math√¥t

This is a working prototype of <https://sigmundai.eu>, an AI-based chatbot that provides sensible answers based on documentation.

Features:

- Privacy: all messages are encrypted so that no-one can listen in on your conversation
- Knowledge: access to OpenSesame and DataMatrix documentation 
- Continuous conversation: conversations are summarized when they become too long to fit into the prompt
- Code execution: basic code-execution abilities in Python and R
- Google Scholar search: ability to search for articles on Google Scholar

Sigmund uses OpenAI (gpt3.5, gpt4) and/ or Anthropic (claude 2.1) chat models and requires API keys.

**Note: for the Q&A and practice bot for teaching (Heymans AI tutor), checkout `release/0.3.0`. The current codebase focuses on a conversational chatbot for user support, and has been renamed to Sigmund.**
