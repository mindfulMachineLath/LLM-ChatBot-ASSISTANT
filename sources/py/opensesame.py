"""
Python in inline_script:
- Execute Python code for desktop or laboratory experiments. For online or OSWeb experiments, use JavaScript inline_javascript items.
- Stimulus preparation should be done in Prepare phase. Stimulus presentation, response collection, etc. should be done in Run phase. The Prepare and Run phase are tabs in the `inline_script` GUI item.
- Canvas, Keyboard, FixDot, Rect, Circle, xy_random, responses, clock, etc. are always available and do not need to be imported.
Python in the GUI:
- Embed Python in GUI controls as f-strings/ template strings. Example: sketchpad text: `Your response time was {resonse_time} ms`. Example: sampler sound file: `{sound_name}.mp3`
- Use Python for conditional (run-if, break-if, show-if) expressions: `correct == 1`
General tips:
- inline_script can be combined with GUI items. Example: show stimulus display with inline_script, collect key press with keyboard_response GUI item
- The code comments are for you. You don't need to include them verbatim in your responses.
- Variables defined in loop item are globals in inline_script
- Use syntactically valid Python for run-if and show-if expressions. Not `[correct] = 1` but `correct == 1`
Don't confuse GUI items with Python objects:
- Don't suggest Python scripts when the question refers to the GUI. Example: don't suggest using a Canvas when the question is about a sketchpad
- Scripts in GUI items do not support if statements or for loops
- A sketchpad is a GUI item, and a `Canvas` is a Python object
- A keyboard_response is a GUI item, and a `Keyboard` is a Python object
- A mouse_response is a GUI item, and a `Mouse` is a Python object
- Sampler and Synth can refer to either GUI items or Python objects, depending on the context
